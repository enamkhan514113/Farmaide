About this project: Around half of the population of Bangladesh is primarily involved in agriculture. The majority of lands in Bangladesh is devoted to crop cultivation. Bangladesh is a land of suitable growth for Paddy, Jute, tea, pulses, Vegetables and fruits. Despite the contribution of agriculture in such large percentage of Bangladeshâ€™s overall economy, Farmers always struggle to fully commercialize their production due to natural calamities and inefficient infrastructure. Also, for a lack of knowledge, investors are afraid to invest in this Sector . So, farmers need money to become successful, investor needs platform to secure invest. And analysing this situation we are introducing a common platform for all. Besides this we also propose a marketplace where farmers will be able to directly sell their product to customer which eliminating the need for intermediaries and providing greater economic opportunities for farmers. In addition to facilitating communication between these two groups, we also plan to introduce a range of advanced technologies that can help to improve agricultural practices in Bangladesh.
